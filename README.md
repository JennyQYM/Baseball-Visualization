# Baseball-Visualization
This the data visualization by baseball player's height, weight, hand habit, hit rate and total score to explore the relationship behind those variables.


- Explanation
The baseball player visualizes a scatter plot. The x value of each point is the height of the athlete, the y value is the hit rate of the athlete, and the radius of the point is measured by the home run score. The higher the score, the larger the radius; the color of the point represents the batter's habit: orange, blue, and green represent the left hand, the right hand, and both hands.


- Exploration
By dividing the data into left and right hands sub dataset, the left-hand hitting rate is concentrated at 0.26 and above, while the right-hand hitting rate is concentrated at 0.28 and below. Overall, the left-hand hitting rate is higher than the right-hand hitting rate.
